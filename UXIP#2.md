UXIP #2

(This UXIP will be created and deliberated based on UXIP#1 and its implementation in most recent MVPs)

From previous bullets:
- Help user backup wallet(keystore) from within application (how to backup?)
- Upgradeable from within the application
- Provide some links in application to online forum, Q&A, etc. on web site to enable users to have feedback. e.g. forum.musicoin.org can be a place to link.
- Redesigning "play" button to put Pay-Per-Play more visualized with player

New bullets:
- Mining only when it's not playing
- Putting wallet to left bottom corner for bigger space and linking to payment history
- Default user name shown as shortened address 0xaa71..07ca
- showing errors at Startup
- focus on password field entering app
- a more complete profile of musician
- an exploration to separate between artist and publisher
- List view of songs with their PPP/tip values
- Display the sync status of blockchain(which maybe far behind current number and affect usability)

Questions:
- How to downsize the size of package itself? or make a installer program?
