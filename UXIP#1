UXIP #1

Several bullets:

- Musicians should be able to see the detail income of their works
- The playlist/music works and release display should be different in visual
- User can set the ceiling of automatic PPP (e.g. 2 Musicoin) to prevent overpayment
- Displaying 3 views of PPP license when user click a music with its details. Musicians can preview the license layers as well before they press the "release" button.
- Display PPP price surge warning on player(maybe a ♩ with red color)
- remove some technical terms like "ipfs" but using other readable language like "media net", etc.
- upgradeable from within the application
