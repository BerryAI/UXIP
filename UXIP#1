UXIP #1

(This issue of UXIP will be kept in effective before new release of application. Next UXIP will be based on the scrutiny of the most recent release.)

Several bullets:

- Help user backup wallet(keystore) from within application (how to backup?)
- Musicians should be able to see the detail income of their works
- The playlist/music works and release display should be different in visual
- User can set the ceiling of automatic PPP (e.g. 2 Musicoin) to prevent overpayment
- Displaying 3 views of PPP license when user click a music with its details. Musicians can preview the license layers as well before they press the "release" button.
- Display PPP price surge warning on player(maybe a â™© with red color)
- Remove some technical terms like "ipfs" but using other readable language like "media net", etc.
- Upgradeable from within the application
- Indicate current application version and tell users it's running on test network in balance page.
- How to downsize the size of package itself? or make a installer program?
- For alpha software, always displaying it's running on "test network"
- Provide some links in application to online forum, Q&A, etc. on web site to enable users to have feedback. e.g. forum.musicoin.org can be a place to link.
- Redesigning "play" button to put Pay-Per-Play more visualized with player


Questions:
- how to make "freedom" aspect more intuitive? e.g. Musicoin is supposed to make every music work to be licensed easily and shared around the world, if people follows the license. However, if we only provide a confined application, how would this become different from other platform or services? How could it be better to demo more possibilities?
