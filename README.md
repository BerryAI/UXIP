Like any other use-oriented system, we hope Musicoin application and/or the whole system is as usable as it can with design. So along the release of software, we also care the user experience(UX). This repo is to encourage users/developers/designers to help improve UX part collaboratively.

So we will try to have a weekly collection of good ideas from different stake holders and generate it into actions. So welcome everyone contribute ideas with PR([[pull request|https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/]]) based on each the newest UXIP #. Please enjoy this great collaboation and let's make things happen together.
